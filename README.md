# About

The tool generates all the directories and files needed, including default single color images, to compile a bush mission or landing mission. The input file is one single text file containing waypoint names, coordinates, generic mission data, nav log texts, etc. The input file can be generated by the tool from an existing flight plan (PLN file)! There are many options to use to trigger failures, warnings, play WAV files or TTS and much more.

# Development

Eclipse 2020-12 is the prefered IDE for developing BMG.

* Run the application.

### Create JAR file

* Right click on build.xml and select "Run As --> Ant Build...".<br/>
* Under "Environment", add an entry with name = "ECLIPSE_HOME" and value = "{the path to your Eclipse folder}".<br/>

# TO-DO

* What is the Overview.htm file used for in landing challenges?<br/>
* Leaderboards for landing challenges? Possible for 3rd party missions?<br/>
* Is there the possibility of setting the flight departure at the parking area instead of on the runway (leg 2-X)?
