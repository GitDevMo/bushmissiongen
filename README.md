# About

Welcome to BushMissionGen (BMG)! The tool generates all the directories and files needed, including default single color images, to compile a bush mission or landing mission. The input file is one single text file containing waypoint names, coordinates, generic mission data, nav log texts, etc. The input file can be generated by the tool from an existing flight plan (PLN file)! There are many options to use to trigger failures, warnings, play WAV files or TTS and much more.<br>
