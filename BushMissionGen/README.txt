BushMissionGen by f99mlu @ 2021 - The first official mission generator for MSFS 2020!
Requires: Java 8 or newer
Big thanks to Lithilium for the original source files!

The tool generates all the directories and files needed, including default single color images, to compile a bush or landing mission.
The input file is one single text file or XLSX file containing waypoint names, coordinates, generic mission data, nav log texts, etc.
It can be generated by the tool from an existing flight plan (PLN file)!

BushMissionGen will never:
* be a Bing maps screenshot generator for add-on images, loading screens or navlog images.
* generate standard navlog instructions.
* have an extensive GUI for all fields.
* make use of the SimConnect DLL for advanced communication with the sim.
* be a scenery/airport creation tool.

If you require some of those features, check out the excellent Bush Trip Injector by BuffyGC!

Known serious issues (both tool and mission related sim bugs):
- SIM: Using subtitles for sound files only works if the bush mission is not exited and resumed.


HOW-TO:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Create an input file for the tool. Have a look at the sample file (sample_inputfile.txt or the XLSX file) included
   in the default distribution or generate your own input file from scratch by using the PLN conversion feature in BushMissionGen.
1. Double-click on the BushMissionGenerator.jar file to start the application.
2. Select an input file by pressing the "Select" button.
3. Click on the "Generate" button.
4. See the output dir for the generated mission files.

An Activity_Widget.jpg image (816x626), a Loading_Screen.jpg (3840x2160) and a Thumbnail.jpg (412x170) are also generated.
* The JPG images should be Ultra HD or Full HD images with a top/side-view of the airport.
* The PNG images should be smaller images (1200x800 or in that vincinity) and be "screenshots" from Bing Maps or Google Maps.

You can supply images to the input file folder to add images to any navlog sub leg text.
The name must match the POI number (POI5.png, POI22.png, etc). These images are not auto-generated (since it is optional).
If you remove a POI image from the source folder, you must also remove it from the output images folder.
After a change to the POI images (adding or removing POIxxx.png files), you must generate the mission again. Then the tool
will autodetect the images and add them to the mission.

COMPILE WITH THE MSFS2020 SDK:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install the SDK and compile the generated mission files in Developer Mode inside the flight sim by opening the project file.
Then you get a "package" which can be put in the Community folder and seen in-game.


COOL FEATURES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
- Landing challenges can also be generated! Also with failures!!
- You can create input files by converting a PLN file.
- You can compile the generated source files with the SDK (if installed) by triggering the build
  from inside the tool (Tools menu).
- Supports multiple coordinate formats. Examples:
	8°07'34.4"N 98°55'22.0"E
	N8° 07' 34.4",E98° 55' 22.0"
	N65° 18.25',E17° 58.51'
	64.412136, -78.630752
	Little Navmap format
- Validates some input values.
- An input file can be specified on the command line to load it automatically into the application at startup.
- You can customize the weather by editing the weather file (Weather.WPR).
- A number of weather presets can be selected.
- Plane selector (PLN import). There is also a menu option to show ALL planes available on the disk.
- Preview the navlog texts and images before launching the sim.
- Images are never overwritten. This means you can put the final images in the images output directory
  then just change values in the input file and generate over and over again without losing them.
  Same with Weather.WPR.. it will never be overwritten in any output folder.

Some important things. Don´t forget to set the "heading=" field manually.
Also, do not start too far away from the landing point, or you will get an error when you load the mission.
Create at least one custom waypoint and one airport waypoint.


TRANSLATIONS / MULTI-LANGUAGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These rows must be put AFTER the declaration of the route. I.e. after the last airport. Last in the file, so to say :).
Please observe! The main langauage in the sim is English. So, the all the texts above the translations should be in English.
Then you add other languages than English to the input file as translations:

meta|zh-CN||location|translated location

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If the mission does not appear in the FS2020, there is a big chance you have selected a plane that isn´t there.. or misspelled it!
- Make sure you delete the SAVE folder before starting up the simulator to test your compiled mission.
  The path looks something like this: c:\Users\{USER]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\MISSIONS\ACTIVITIES\YOUR-MISSION_SAVE.
- Do you get strange TTS/WAV triggers at the wrong time or place? Make sure you press "HTML preview" when generating and open the LINK
  at the top to see your trip on a map to find overlapping trigger areas etc.

>>>>>>>>>> Good luck! <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
