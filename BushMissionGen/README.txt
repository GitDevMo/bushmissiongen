BushMissionGen by f99mlu @ 2021 - The first official mission generator for MSFS 2020!
Requires: Java 8 or newer
Big thanks to Lithilium for the original source files!

The tool generates all the directories and files needed, including default single color images, to compile a bush or landing mission.
The input file is one single text file or XLSX file containing waypoint names, coordinates, generic mission data, nav log texts, etc.
It can be generated by the tool from an existing flight plan (PLN file)!

BushMissionGen will never:
* be a Bing maps screenshot generator for add-on images, loading screens or navlog images.
* generate standard navlog instructions.
* have an extensive GUI for all fields.
* make use of the SimConnect DLL for advanced communication with the sim.
* be a scenery/airport creation tool.

If you require some of those features, check out the excellent Bush Trip Injector by BuffyGC!

Known serious issues (both tool and mission related sim bugs):
- SIM: Using subtitles for sound files only works if the bush mission is not exited and resumed.
